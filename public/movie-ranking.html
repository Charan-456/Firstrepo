<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>Avatar is the best movie I have ever watched in my life. It is directed by James cameron, One of the best director of 21st century.</p><p> His previous blockbuster "Titanic" is an evergreen movie too. Coming to avatar, It is a visual wonder in the year 2009. </p>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>Its not a movies but a anime series made by japan artist kishimato. I loved the story line of naruto pretty much, mostly the characterization of vilains and their backdrop is fantastic. Atlast the main protagonist "Naruto" fighting against those villains is an eye feast. </p>
<h3>Hidy</h3>
<p>It is a cartoon made by an english television company later on dubbed into many regional languages.</p>
